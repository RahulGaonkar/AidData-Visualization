# AidData-Visualization
Geo Visualization with D3.js
## Synopsis
Developed Choropleth map to answer the three below questions:
1. Do the countries that donate the most tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world?
2. Do the countries that receive the most tend to cluster around specific geographical areas of the world?
3. Are there neighboring countries that have radically different patterns in terms of how much they receive vs. how much they donate?

**Dataset:**<br>
***Name: AidData.csv*** <br>
